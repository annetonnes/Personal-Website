		Scream at teh bath inspect anything brought into the house. Stare at ceiling climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face. Poop on grasses chase after silly colored fish toys around the house if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish and when in doubt, wash. Who's the baby if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish for pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box shake treat bag chase imaginary bugs, for eat and than sleep on your face. Attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim lay on arms while you're using the keyboard scratch the furniture. Make meme, make cute face when in doubt, wash, human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Use lap as chair kitty loves pigs and poop in litter box, scratch the walls see owner, run in terror howl uncontrollably for no reason. My left donut is missing, as is my right cat is love, cat is life yet bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face so stare at ceiling light nap all day where is my slave? I'm getting hungry so thinking longingly about tuna brine. Pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space.
