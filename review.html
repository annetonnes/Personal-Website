		<h1> Review </h1>
		Annelies her website is very welcoming. The navigation is straight-forward and stays the same for each page. She makes good use of hover and it clear which page is currently active. On several of her pages, including the homepage she uses auto-generated text, because of this there is little 'happy talk'. The homepage could have contained more information about why the site was created, for example that is was an assignment for a university course.
		<h3> Scannability </h3>
		It might be clear on which page I am, but I would not know how to find something specific on a page because it often consists of a small wall of text. However, on the pages that do not use auto-generated text - the pineapple sorbet page, logboek and review - the scannability is better. With a reasonably big h1 and clear and short subsections. Eventhough the titles of each page do not draw a lot of attention, the title in combination with a clear indication of the active page in the menu, are sufficient to highlight what the content of the page should be. 
		
		<h3>Attention</h3>
		There are no parts of the site that, for example try to sell something, the lack of such content also decreases the need to add design elements that scream for attention. This makes the website comfortable to use because of its calm design. The parts of the site that attract a reasonable amount of attention, besides the content, are the head shot and the background. However, I found neither of them too distracting.
		
		<h3>Improvement</h3>
		There is little that I can think of that could improve the website. Of course, when adding actual information to the pages Home, About myself, hobbies and studies, Annelies should pay attention to preventing the text from becoming a wall. Considering her other pages, I suspect this won't be a problem.<br />
		Considering the coding of the design, she could improve the way the background is currently done. Making sure that it does not stop when pages are too long and maybe making it slightly transparent would improve the looks of the site.<br />
		The last suggestion I have is creating more destinction between the navigation, titles and content. Adding an extra font or playing a bit with colors could work. However, I do appreciate the current tranquility of the site. Creating more differtiation might also create more unwanted turbulence.
